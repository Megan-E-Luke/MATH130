# Introduction
I am a graduate student at California State University, Chico. I am in the process of completing an Interdisciplinary Master's degree in Integrated Pest Management and Agroecology. While I love field work and agronomic research, in my time at Chico State I have also discovered a love for code and data science! This website is an experiment in keeping an online portfolio of my research, and an opportunity to continue to display my skills both as a researcher, and as a data scientist. Thanks for visiting!
