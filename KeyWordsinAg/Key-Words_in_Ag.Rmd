The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use a Twitter developer app to collect and analyze key word trends on topics in agriculture.

## Using rtweet

First things first, you will need to download the appropriate libraries for use in R.


```{r}
library(rtweet)
library(httr)
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, if you don't already have one, you will need to create a personal Twitter account at www.twitter.com


## Creating an API

This part of the tutorial may take a little time, as applications for developer apps are reviewed by Twitter staff. There is a ton of information about what you can do with a developer app at developer.twitter.com
