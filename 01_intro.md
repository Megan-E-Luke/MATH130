## Purpose

* Get you up and running with basic ability to use `R` and Markdown.

## Logistics
* **Course Website:** https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/
* **Data Camp:** Free online tool to learn R. 
  

## Structure of this class

* Content is fully online on the course website.  
* Class time is spent walking through labs and on the spot debugging / expanding on ideas and concepts.
* Credit / No Credit, get 70% of the points and you pass.
    - All assignments and points are laid out explicitly in the syllabus. 


## Time Committment & Frustration
* Fast paced, we're hitting the ground running and only have 5 weeks. 
* Not designed to teach you everything about R, just enough to make you dangerous. 
* Daily practice will pay off.  
* But can be very rewarding

## Why use R Studio?

- Customizable workspace that docks all windows together. 
- Notebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, STAN)
- Syntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses. 
- Cross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.
- Tab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available. 
- Free training videos available from the developers directly.
- Built in version control 
- One button publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, interactive visualizations, presentations, websites (like this one!)


## Programming is scary! Why can i just learn how to read output?

* Learning to program has other benefits
    - Improves your logical skills and critical problem solving
    - Increases your attention to detail
    - Increases your self reliance and empowers you to control your own research.
    - Your PI will love your awesome graphics and reports. 
    - Some people think what you do is magic. 
    - Thinking graduate school? [[expect to learn this on your own]](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/full/nj7638-563a.html)

## Why no point and click?

Because it's not reproducible.

* Which boxes did you click last time? 
* New data? Gotta do it all over.
* Need to expand your model? Gotta do it all over. 
* Made a mistake in the data coding? Gotta do it all over...

## Getting Help 

* Your first resource is each other. 
    - Googling R code is a separate skill you will learn over time. 
* Many on and off campus resources - listed in the [Help/FAQ page](../faq.html). 


## Getting Started

* Complete the first chapter - **Intro to Basics** by the next class. 
* There is a progress bar at the bottom of this page. You can track your progress through each chapter here.
