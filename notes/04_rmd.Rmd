# Introduction

In this lesson you will learn to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using `knitr` and related tools, and organize a data analysis sandbox so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.


### Student Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson students will be able to create a reproducible R Markdown document that integrates written text, R code and output into a literate document.  


# Requirements

* R and R Studio must be installed
* The following R packages must be installed: `rmarkdown` and `knitr`. (See Lesson 02 for instructions)

# Appearance

R Markdown combines normal text like this, code (shown in a colored box below) and the output from the code directly following with two proceeding pound signs (#). 

```{r}
2+2
```

Code chunks start with three back ticks (to the left of the 1) and an r in brackets ` `{r}`. They close (end) with another three back ticks. Note the background color has changed to a ligher shade. This helps you identify you have closed your code chunk properly.

You can insert code chunks by using the button in the top right of an RMD file (Insert --> R), 
or by typing  CTRL + ALT + I. 

Only code goes in code chunks. That's why they're called **code** chunks. No normal text. All explanatory text goes outside a code chunk.

R Markdown files have a file extension of `.Rmd`. 

# Test your setup

Let's create your first markdown file!

1. In R Studio go to _File_ --> _New File_ --> _R Markdown_
2. Title this document **My First R Markdown Document**, then click OK.
3. Click the small blue disk icon to save this file into your class folder. 
4. Save this file using the file name **test_markdown_document**. 
    - `r emo::ji("warning")` File names cannot have spaces or special characters.
    - `r emo::ji("warning")`Do not specify the file type. It will be set automatically. 
5. Click the **KNIT** button (has the yarn ball next to it) to convert this file into HTML. 
6. Look at the HTML file that was created. You should be able to match the code with the resulting output. 

This is what we mean by reproducible. If you make a change in the code document, and re-knit (aka compile), your changes will be reflected in the generated document. 

> Try this:  
> 1. Change the code from `summary(cars)` to `summary(iris)`.   
> 2. Write a sentence below

# Start the first homework

1. **Right click** and select **save as** (or save target as) to download [[HW 1.Rmd]](../hw/HW1.Rmd) code file to your class folder. 
2. Navigate to your class folder and double click to open this file in R Studio
    - You might have to tell your computer what program to use. 
    - `r emo::ji("x")``r emo::ji("x")` Do NOT open this file from your browser window. `r emo::ji("x")``r emo::ji("x")`
4. Knit this file to HTML. 
5. Look at each piece of the output around problem 0. Mentally match each piece of output with the corresponding section in the RMD file. 
6. This provides a homework template for you to use to write your assignment. Write your answers directly into this document. 
7. Submit the **RMD** file before the due date. I will knit the file on my machine and grade the result. Make sure it looks good before turning it in!
