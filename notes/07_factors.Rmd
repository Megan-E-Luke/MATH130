# Introduction
In this lesson we will discuss ways to organize and deal with categorical data, also known as factor data types. 


### Student Learning Objectives
After completing this lesson students will be able to

* Convert a numeric variable to a factor variable. 
* Apply labels to factor 
* Understand and control the ordering of the factor. 
* Use functions from the `forcats` package. 


##### Prior to this lesson learners should

* Download the [[07_factors_notes.Rmd]](07_factors_notes.Rmd) R markdown file and save into your `scripts/Math130` folder. 
* Write the code to import the `email` data set into this notes file. Run it to make sure it works. 
* Install the `forcats` package. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(forcats)
email <- read.table("../data/email.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
```

The goal of the `forcats` package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.
Often in R there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task. Some examples in this lesson will show how to 
perform a certain task using base R functions, as well as functions from the `forcats` package.

# What is a factor?
The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables. The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable corresponds to a limited number of categories, while a continuous variable can correspond to an infinite number of values.

An example of a categorical variable is the `number` variable in the `email` data set. This variable contains data on whether there was no number, a small number (under 1 million), or a big number in the content of the email. 

First we should confirm that R sees `number` as a factor. 
```{r}
class(email$number)
```

We can use the `levels()` function to get to know factor variables. 

```{r}
levels(email$number)
```

There are three levels: `big`, `none`, and `small`. 

How many records are in each level?

**Base R**
```{r}
table(email$number)
```

**forcats**
```{r}
fct_count(email$number)
```

# Convert a number to Factor

Typically data are entered into the computer using numeric codes such as 0 and 1. These codes stand for categories, such as "no" and "yes". Sometimes we want to analyze these binary variables in two ways: 

* For statistical analyses, the data must be numeric 0/1.
* For many graphics, the data must be a factor, "no/yes".

**Example: Is the email flagged as spam?**
The `spam` variable is recorded as an integer variable with values 0 and 1. 
```{r}
table(email$spam)
class(email$spam)
```

We use the function `factor()` to convert the numeric variable `spam` to a factor, applying `lables` to convert 0 to "no" and 1 to "yes". 

```{r}
email$spam_fac <- factor(email$spam, labels=c("no", "yes"))
```

The ordering of the `labels` argument _must_ be in the same order (left to right) as the factor levels themselves. Look back at the order of columns in the `table` - it goes 0 then 1. Thus our labels need to go "no" then "yes". 

**Always confirm your recode** 

Here we confirm that the new variable was created corectly by creating a two-way contingency table by calling the `table(old variable, new variable)` function on both the old and new variables. 

```{r}
table(email$spam, email$spam_fac, useNA="always")
```

Here we see that all the 0's were recoded to 'no's, and all the 1's recoded to "yes"'s, and there are no new missing values. Success!

# Factor ordering
Let's revisit the variable `number`, that contains the size of the number in the email. 

```{r}
table(email$number)
```

Specifically the ordering from left to right of the factors. Seem odd? This is ordinal data, in that `none` is inherently "smaller" than `small`, which is smaller than `big`. But the ordering goes `big` - `none` - `small`, which is in Alphabetical order!

Gee thanks R. Exactly how I want my factors ordered (NOT!) Let's see a few ways of how to control the ordering. 

## Manually specified 
We need to take control of these factors! We can do that by re-factoring the existing factor variable, but this time specifying the `levels` of the factor (since it already has labels).

**Base R**
```{r}
factor(email$number, levels=c("none", "small", "big")) %>% table()
```

**forcats**
```{r}
email$number %>% fct_relevel("none", "small", "big") %>% table()
```

Now it's in a readable, left to right in increasing content size order. This will be important for graphing. 

## Order by frequency
The size of the number in an email is _ordinal_, meaning the levels have an internal order. _Nominal_ categorical
data does not have a natural ordering. One preferrable way to order the levels of a nominal variable is by the frequency of the levels. The `forcats` function `fct_infreq()` accomplishes this task. 

```{r}
email$number %>% fct_infreq() %>% table()
```

There are more emails with small numbers in it than there are emails with no numbers, which shows up more often than emails with big numbers. 

## Reversed order

Again, `forcats` to the rescue here. Let's remind ourselves what the original ordering was: 

```{r}
table(email$number)
```

And now to reverse this ordering, 
```{r}
email$number %>% fct_rev() %>% table()
```

This just *happens* to be the same as in decreasing frequency order.

# Factor (re)naming
Sometimes factors come to us in names we don't prefer. We want them to say something else. 

**Base R**
The easiest way here is to re-factor the variable and apply new `labels`. 
```{r}
email$my_new_number <- factor(email$number, labels=c("1M+", "None", "<1M"))
```

Ok, but did this work? Trust, but verify. 
```{r}
table(email$number, email$my_new_number, useNA="always")
```

The "big" factor is now labeled "1M+", "none" is named "None", and "small" is "<1M".

**forcats**: use the `fct_recode("NEW" = "old")` function here. 
```{r}
email$my_forcats_number <- email$number %>% fct_recode("BIG" = "big", "NONE" = "none", "SMALL" = "small")
table(email$number, email$my_forcats_number, useNA="always")
```
