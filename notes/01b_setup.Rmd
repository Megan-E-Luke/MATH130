# 3. Setting preferences in R Studio to retain sanity while debugging

* Open R Studio and go to the file menu go to Tools then Global Options.
* Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" 
* Where it says "Save workspace to .RData on exit:" Select "Never""
* Click apply then ok to close that window.
  
This will ensure that when you restart R you do not "carry forward" objects such as data sets that you were working on in a prior assignment. 

It is _highly_ recommended to completely shut down R studio when you are done working. 
    
 
# 4. Set up a class folder 

The desktop may be a convienant place to put your files, 

Create a class folder created on your computer using one of the options below:

    - ALL CAPS (MATH130)
    - no caps (math130)
    - snake_case (math_130)
    - CamelCase (Math130) is not recommended (do you want to remember what letters were capitalized?)

* Put all files related to this class in here. 
* This means when you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file. Do not let files live in your downloads folder. 
* <span style="color:red">Do not open any files from your browser window after downloading. </span>
