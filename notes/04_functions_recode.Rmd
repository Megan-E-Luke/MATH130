# Introduction
In this lesson we will introduce how to use functions to summarize data in a data frame, and to do basic data management tasks such as removing missing values. 


### Student Learning Objectives
After completing this lesson students will be able to

* Work with variables inside a data frame
* Summarize data in the presence of missing data elements in a data table. 
* Make new variables inside a data frame. 
* Selectively edit (and recode) data elements. 

We'll use the data set on births in North Carolina for this lesson. 

```{r}
NCbirths <- read.csv("data/NCbirths.csv", header=TRUE)
```

# What's a function? 

Functions take inputs, called **arguments** and provide outputs, or results. A few functions you have already used are `head()`, `table()` and `subset()`. Let's look at the `mean` function again by typing ?mean. 

The **Usage** section of the documentation includes two versions of the mean() function; What's the difference? The first function 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean(x,...)
```

is the most general definition of the mean function. This section also shows you what the default values for each argument are. This is a very important piece to pay attention. Sometimes the default behaviors are not what you want to happen. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```
In the **Arguments** section the help file defines what each argument does.

* `x` is the object that you want to take the mean of
* `trim` is a number from 0 to 0.5 that defines the fraction of observations 
  to be excluded from each side before the mean is calculated. 
* `na.rm` is a logical value (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) that tells `R` whether NA values 
  should be stripped before the computation proceeds.
* `...` is called the ellipsis, and it is a way for R to pass arguments to or 
  from other methods without the function having to name them explicitly. 

### Argument ordering
A function's arguments can be named, or can be referred to by position. As an example, let's look at the variable on the `NCbirths` data set that contains data on the fathers age: `NCbirths$fage`. 
  
If we were to calculate the mean, we'd get NA. 
```{r}
mean(NCbirths$fage)
```

We need to tell R to _remove_ the `NA`'s from the data prior to calculating the mean. 
```{r}
mean(NCbirths$fage, na.rm=TRUE)
```

It worked fine because I named the argument to remove missing values. What if I didn't state what that argument was? 
```{r, error=TRUE}
mean(NCbirths$fage, TRUE)
```

R is expecting a value for trim as the second argument and doesn't know what to do with the value `TRUE`. If you name the arguments, then the order is irrelevant. 

```{r}
mean(na.rm=TRUE, x=NCbirths$fage, trim=.1)
```

But let's not get that crazy. 

R, at its heart, is a functional programming language [(cite: Adv. R by Wickham)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html). We interact with the program, and data, using functions.

# Summarizing data

There are two main methods to summarize data. Both were introduced in the last lesson: `table()` for categorical factor variables, and `summary()` for numeric variables. 

**Frequency Tables for categorical data**
Let's look at the variable for whether or not the baby was born underweight. R acknowledges it is a factor variable already. 
```{r}
class(NCbirths$lowbirthweight)
```

You can create a frequency table by using the `table()` function. The `useNA="always"` argument tells `R` to always include an entry for missing values `<NA>`, even if there are none. 

```{r}
table(NCbirths$lowbirthweight, useNA="always")
```

**Summary statistics for numerical data**
Numerical variables can be summarized using statistics such as the min, max, mean and median. The function `summary()` prints out the five number summary, and includes the mean. 

```{r}
summary(NCbirths$visits)
```

Mothers included in this data set visited the doctor on average 12.1 times during their pregnancy.

# Recoding data

Sometimes we have a need to edit, or change data. We can change values of existing data by using logical statements.

Recall the Data Camp lesson on Matricies. To choose all observations (rows) of a `data` set, where a `variable` is equal to some `value`, you would type
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data[data$variable==value]
```

We can use this method of selecting rows, to change data in those specific rows. 


**Example 1: Too low birthweight**

Let's look at the numerical distribution of birthweight of the baby. 

```{r}
summary(NCbirths$weight)
```

The value of 1 lb seems very low. The researchers you are working with decide that is a mistake and should be excluded from the data. We would then set all records where `weight=1` to missing. 

```{r}
NCbirths$weight[NCbirths$weight==1] <- NA
```

The specific variable `NCbirths$weight` is on the far left, outside the `[]`. So just the variable `weight` is being changed. 

But what about other weights that aren't quite as low as 1, but still unusually low? The boxplot below shows outlying values as dots on the low end of birthweight. 

```{r}
boxplot(NCbirths$weight)
```

Let's set all birthweights less than 4 lbs to missing. 

```{r}
NCbirths$weight[NCbirths$weight < 4] <- NA
```

It is important to plott the data again, to make sure that there are no values below 4 now. 
```{r}
boxplot(NCbirths$weight)
```

# Creating new variables

New variables should be added to the data frame. This can be done using `$` sign notation. 

The new variable you want to create goes on the left side of the assignment operator `<-`, and how you want to create that new variable goes on the right side. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data$new_variable <- creation statement
```

#### **Example: basic arithmetic on existing variables**

As a pregnancy progresses, both the mother and the baby gain weight. The variable `gained` is the total amount of weight the mother gained in her pregnancy. The variable `weight` is how much the baby weighed at birth.

The following code creates a new variable `wtgain_mom` the weight gained by the mother, that is not due to the baby by subtracting `weight` from `gained`.
```{r}
NCbirths$wtgain_mom <- NCbirths$gained - NCbirths$weight
```

To confirm this variable was created correctly, we look at the data contained in three variables in question. 

```{r}
head(NCbirths[,c('gained', 'weight', 'wtgain_mom')])
```



#### **Example: Using `ifelse()` to create a binary variable**

Let's add a variable to identify if a mother in the North Carolina births data set was underage at the time of birth. 

* We will define this as if the mothers age `mage` is under 18. 
* We will create a new factor varible with two values: `underage` and `adult`. 
* We will use the `ifelse()` function. 
    - It's set of arguments are: `ifelse(logical, value if TRUE, value if FALSE)`
    - The `logical` argument is a statement that resolves as a `boolean` variable, as either TRUE or FALSE.
    - The second argument is what you want the resulting varible to contain if the logical argument is `TRUE`
    - The last argument is what you want the resulting varible to contain if the logical argument is `FALSE`

Make a new variable `underage` on the `NCbirths` data set. If `mage` is under 18, then the value of this new variable is `underage`, else it is labeled as `adult`. 

```{r}
NCbirths$underage <- ifelse(NCbirths$mage <= 18, "underage", "adult")
```

You should always make sure your code works as intended.

* First let's look at the frequency table of `underage` and see if records exist with the new categories, and if there are any missing values. 
```{r}
table(NCbirths$underage, useNA="always")
```
* Next let's check it against the value of `mage` itself. Let's look at all rows where mothers age is either 18 or 19 `mage %in% c(18,19)`, and only the columns of interest. 

```{r}
NCbirths[NCbirths$mage %in% c(18,19),c('mage', 'underage')]
```

# Additional References

This lesson was an introduction to typical basic data management tasks. In lesson 06 you will learn how to use functions in the `dplyr` package to perform the same, and more different data management tasks, in a more streamline manner. Both levels of techniques are equally usefull depending on the task. 

There are always many ways to approach a problem in R. Our goal in this class is to provide you with a few ways to think of a problem. You will find what fits best for your coding style as you progress. 


There are several other Data Camp courses that all have the first chapter free that you can use to get a start on learning more about how to import and clean up data. Here are a few.
