# Math 130: Introduction to R - Fall 18 

[[Download this syllabus as a PDF]](syllabus.pdf)

# Course Description
This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible research and literate programming for data analysis. The target audience is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will cumulate with an peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a pre-specified data set or your data set of choice.

# Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Import external data into R.
* Calculate summary statistics.
* Create new variables using different data types. 
* Create informative data visualizations and tables.
* Perform data management techniques such as subsetting, grouping, summarizing. 
* Create a reproducible research document.
* Conduct an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner.

# Required Materials

* A reliable laptop, chromebook, tablet that can use a browser to access the internet.
* Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.
* A Data Camp account. This is an free online tool to learn R.

#### Software
During the last week (or earlier) you will install R and R Studio on your personal computer (Mac/PC/*nix only). That way you can take what you've learned in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are free. Walk through installation instructions can be found here: https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/ 

* R version 3.5.0 or later. Download from https://cran.r-project.org/ 
* R Studio version 1.1 or later. Download the desktop version from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download




# Time Commitment

> For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the "credit hour" is defined as ... not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit. 

This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class during these 5 weeks. That's 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework per week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers, you may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient time during week 5 to work on the project. 

You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is just a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will not learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path where you can continue to learn and improve.
