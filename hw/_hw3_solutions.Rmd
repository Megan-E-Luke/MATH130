This lab uses the `dplyr` and `nycflights13` packages. It is good habit to load all packages in the first code chunk. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
```


# Basic verbs
You will use the `flights` data set for the next few exercises.  Let's load that into our working environment so we can look at it.
```{r}
flights <- flights
```

* At each step use the assignment operator `<-` to store the results into a new data table and use that data in the next step. 
* At each step, print out the resulting data frame so you can see the results. 

1. Use `select()` to extract the following variables: `origin`, `distance`, and `air_time`, `dest`. 

```{r}
f1 <- flights %>% select(origin, distance, air_time, dest)
f1
```

2. Use `filter()` to select only the flights whose destination (`dest`) is Atlanta (ATL)

```{r}
f2 <- f1 %>% filter(dest == 'ATL')
f2
```

3. Use `mutate()` to create a new variable `speed` that calculates speed of the plane as `distance/air_time*60.

```{r}
f3 <- f2 %>% mutate(speed = distance/air_time*60)
f3
```


# How many passengers can a plane hold before needing another engine? 
This question uses the `planes` data set. Let's load that into our working environment so we can look at it.
```{r}
planes <- planes
```


1. Examine the variable `engines` using `table()` and `class`. What is it's data type? 


```{r}
table(planes$engines)
class(planes$engines)
```

The number of engines is an integer variable with values between 1 and 4. 

2. There are too few planes with more than 2 engines. Recode all records with 4 engines to a value of 3. _Hint: Revisit lesson 04_. Create a `table` of this variable again to ensure that all 4's are now 3's. 

```{r}
planes$engines[planes$engines==4] <- 3
table(planes$engines)
```


3. Create a new factor variable `num_engines` from `engines` with labels "one", "two", "three+". 

```{r}
planes$num_engines <- factor(planes$engines, labels=c("one", "two", "three+"))
```


4. Create a two-way `table` of `engines` against `new_engines` to confirm that this new factor variable was created correctly. 

```{r}
table(planes$num_engines, planes$engines)
```


5. Use `dplyr` chaining magic to...

* take the planes data set _and then_...
* `group_by`the `num_engines` _and then_...
* use `summarise` to create three new variables: 
    - `ave_seats` as the `mean()` number of `seats`
    - `min_seats` as the `min()` number of `seats`
    - `max_seats` as the `max()` number of `seats`


```{r}
planes %>% group_by(num_engines) %>% summarise(ave_seats = mean(seats), 
                                               min_seats = min(seats), 
                                               max_seats = max(seats))
```
